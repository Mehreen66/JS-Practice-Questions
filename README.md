 1. Write a code to check difference between null and undefined data type. Also check their type using typeof
    In JavaScript, both null and undefined represent the absence of a value, but they are distinct data types.

    let x;           // variable declared but not initialized
    console.log(x);  // Output: undefined

    let y = null;    // variable intentionally set to null
    console.log(y);  // Output: null
